# Ternary-Tree
Purpose: This program is designed to take a stream of random integers and
organize them into a ternery tree. This tree is then output to the user,
with each child node having parenthasis around it. The program takes one
argument, n, which indicates how many numbers the program will insert 
into the tree before it prints.

How to use: This program works best when paired with randGen.pl. after 
compiling, you can run the program by typing into the command line:


$ ./randGen.pl x y | ./ternary n

where:
x = seed for randomization
y = max number that randGen will input
n = max number of integers that will be input into the binary tree.
